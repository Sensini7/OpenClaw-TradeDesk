## Valid Setups

### 1. XAUUSD (Gold) — LONG — Trend Continuation ⭐ PRIORITY
- **Confidence**: HIGH
- **Matching Rules**: 
  - Rule #8: "Gold is primary" — XAUUSD setups get priority analysis
  - Rule #6: "Fundamental awareness" — Stagflation narrative active (GDP miss + hot inflation)
  - Rule #1: Clear bullish trend on higher timeframes
- **Rationale**: Gold rallying +2.70% on macro hedge demand. Stagflation trade (weak GDP + elevated inflation) is classic gold catalyst. Price action confirms bullish momentum. This is the trader's primary instrument with strong fundamental backing.
- **Current Status**: Needs lower timeframe structure (1H) for entry confirmation
- **Key Driver**: Macro fundamentals (stagflation narrative) + safe-haven demand
- **Next Step**: Wait for pullback/retest on 1H chart, then enter continuation (Rule #2: wait for 1H candle close)

### 2. GBPUSD — SHORT — Breakdown Setup
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM
- **Matching Rules**:
  - Rule #1: "Never trade against the trend" — Daily bearish, only look for sells ✓
  - Rule #6: "Fundamental awareness" — BoE dovish divergence vs Fed/BoJ
- **Rationale**: Clear downside bias below 1.3489. BoE policy outlook is dovish while other central banks maintain tighter stance. Scout forecast sees further weakness below 1.3430. Fundamental driver is strong and persistent.
- **Current Status**: Needs technical entry structure on 1H chart
- **Key Driver**: BoE dovish policy divergence + tariff uncertainty weighing on GBP
- **Next Step**: Wait for breakdown-retest of support level (Rule #3) before entering short

### 3. USDJPY — LONG — Structural Trend
- **Confidence**: MEDIUM
- **Matching Rules**:
  - Rule #6: "Fundamental awareness" — BoJ rate hike expectations fading = JPY structural weakness
  - Rule #1: Clear bullish trend direction
- **Rationale**: USD/JPY at 155.8630 with bullish bias intact. BoJ policy reversal (reduced rate hike bets) creates structural JPY weakness. This is a longer-term theme, not just intraday noise. Note: DXY flat (Rule #5) means bullish move is JPY-driven, not USD strength.
- **Current Status**: Needs pullback for entry; no chase
- **Key Driver**: BoJ policy pivot (less hawkish) = JPY weakness persists
- **Next Step**: Wait for retest of breakout structure on 1H chart (Rule #3)

## Watch List (Interesting but Not Ready)

### USDCAD — Ascending Triangle Formation
- **Status**: PRE-BREAKOUT — needs to clear 1.3740 first
- **Why Watch**: Scout identifies ascending triangle at 1.3706; bullish continuation pattern forming
- **Matching Rule**: Rule #3 applies — if breaks 1.3740, wait for RETEST before entering
- **Action**: Monitor for breakout above 1.3740, then wait for pullback to enter continuation
- **Don't Chase**: Must wait for structure to complete

## Filtered Out (Does Not Match Strategy)

- **EURUSD**: Range-bound (1.1750-1.1830), no clear trend direction — violates Rule #1 (need directional bias for entry)
- **GBPJPY**: Mixed signal (🟡), JPY weakness vs GBP weakness = two-way fight, no clear setup
- **AUDUSD**: Range-bound + HIGH EVENT RISK (Australian CPI due TODAY) — violates Rule #1 (no clear trend) and adds excessive uncertainty

## Market Context & Risk Factors

### DXY Status (Rule #5)
- **UUP (DXY Proxy)**: $27.09, 0.00% flat
- **Implication**: USD has NO directional bias today
- **For USD Pairs**: Bullish USD pairs (USDJPY, USDCAD) are driven by counter-currency weakness, NOT USD strength

### No-Trade Conditions
- **AI sector repricing** continues to pressure equities; fragile risk sentiment
- **Tariff uncertainty** creating two-way flows in EUR and commodity currencies
- **High-impact event risk**: Australian CPI due today (affects AUD crosses)

### Daily Bias Summary
- **BULLISH**: Gold (stagflation macro), USDJPY (BoJ fade), USDCAD (technical)
- **BEARISH**: GBPUSD (BoE divergence)
- **NEUTRAL/AVOID**: EURUSD, AUDUSD (range-bound), GBPJPY (mixed)

## Oracle Notes
- Gold gets priority attention per trader preference — strongest setup today
- All setups need 1H candle confirmation before entry (Rule #2)
- All breakouts need retest structure (Rule #3) — no chasing momentum
- Maximum 3 valid setups today (quality over quantity)
- Risk-R requirement: minimum 1:2 intraday, target 1:4-1:6 for swings
