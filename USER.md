## Strategy Rules (THE GOLD — agents apply these strictly)
1. Never trade against the trend
2. Wait for 1-hour candle confirmation before entry
3. Always wait for retest after breakout — no chasing
4. Use weekly chart breakdown for directional bias
5. Monitor DXY for USD pair correlation
6. Incorporate fundamental awareness (CPI, Fed, tariffs, NFP)
7. Use partial take profits (TP1 conservative, TP2 extended)
8. Move SL to breakeven after TP1 hit
9. Gold is primary instrument — gets priority attention
