# Sentinel Daily Notes — 2026-02-24

## Risk Check Summary
- **Time**: 12:30 PM Africa/Lagos | 11:30 AM UTC
- **Account**: $10,000 | Risk per trade: 1% ($100)
- **Max concurrent positions**: 3
- **Market condition**: Fragile risk sentiment (AI repricing) + tariff uncertainty + stagflation narrative

## Signals Evaluated

### ✅ XAUUSD — LONG (APPROVED)
**Trigger confidence**: HIGH | **Signal quality**: EXCELLENT
- **Entry mechanism**: 1H pullback/retest (not yet triggered)
- **Stop**: 2,845 | **TP1**: 2,895 | **TP2**: 2,920
- **Risk profile**: 2,500 pips stop = $25,000/lot → 0.004 lots to risk $100
- **Position size**: 0.004 lots → **Adjusted to 0.003 lots** (25% reduction for Australian CPI today)
- **Position value**: ~$861 (8.6% of account) ✅ Within limits
- **R:R**: TP1 = 2.0:1 ✅ TP2 = 3.0:1 ✅ Both excellent
- **Why approved**: 
  - Gold is priority instrument per strategy rules
  - High-impact day adjustment applied (AUS CPI flagged)
  - Strong macro thesis (stagflation hedge)
  - Bullish momentum confirmation (+2.70% intraday)
  - Conservative R:R targets
  - Position sizing well within 20% account limit even after adjustment
- **Execution note**: Ready to enter on 1H pullback confirmation; move SL to BE after TP1

### ❌ GBPUSD — SHORT (REJECTED)
**Trigger confidence**: MEDIUM | **Signal quality**: GOOD (rejected on mechanics, not fundamentals)
- **Entry mechanism**: Breakdown-retest below 1.3489 (not yet triggered)
- **Stop**: 1.3520 | **TP1**: 1.3425 | **TP2**: 1.3350
- **Risk profile**: 310 pips stop = $3,100/lot → 0.0323 lots to risk $100
- **Position value**: ~$4,359 (43.6% of account) ❌ EXCEEDS 20% LIMIT
- **R:R**: TP1 = 1.81:1 ✅ (acceptable, above 1.5 minimum)
- **Why rejected**:
  - Stop distance is too wide relative to account size
  - Even at 1% risk, position consumes 43.6% of capital
  - Violates hard position limit rule (max 20% per trade)
  - No mitigation possible without either:
    - Tightening SL (reduces R:R, may trigger noise)
    - Accepting smaller risk (0.5% would make position 21.8% — still over)
- **Thesis quality**: BoE dovish divergence + technical breakdown valid, but setup requires tighter entry/stop for this account size
- **Action**: Hold until better setup emerges (tighter SL or wider TP targets)

### ❌ USDJPY — LONG (REJECTED)
**Trigger confidence**: MEDIUM | **Signal quality**: GOOD (rejected on mechanics, not fundamentals)
- **Entry mechanism**: Pullback/retest (not yet triggered)
- **Stop**: 155.200 | **TP1**: 156.650 | **TP2**: 157.350
- **Risk profile**: ~250 basis points stop = large pip count due to JPY scaling → position forces 26% of capital
- **Position value**: ~$2,596 (26% of account) ❌ EXCEEDS 20% LIMIT
- **R:R**: TP1 = 4.8:1 ✅ (exceptional)
- **Why rejected**:
  - Wide stop distance (250 basis points) is inherent to setup structure
  - Creates forced large position despite excellent R:R
  - Position exceeds 20% account limit
  - JPY pairs have floating pip values; wider stops = larger capital allocation
- **Thesis quality**: BoJ rate hike fade + JPY structural weakness valid; geopolitical tailwinds noted
- **Action**: Hold until better pullback/retest (closer to entry, tighter stop)

## Key Findings

### Pattern Recognition
Two out of three signals rejected on **position sizing mechanics alone**, not on fundamentals or R:R quality. This indicates:
1. **Trigger is generating good setups** (medium-high confidence, valid theses)
2. **Account size constraint is binding** — the $10k account with 1% per-trade risk (max $100) makes positions too large on wide-stop setups
3. **Possible trader solutions**:
   - Increase account size to reduce position sizing pressure
   - Accept lower R:R targets to tighten stops
   - Increase acceptable risk per trade (trade 2% instead of 1%, accepting higher daily loss cap)
   - Filter for tighter-stop setups only

### High-Impact Day Adjustment
- **Australian CPI due today** → Applied 25% position reduction to XAUUSD
- Reduced position from 0.004 to 0.003 lots
- Reduced risk from $100 to $75
- Setup remains valid and safer in volatile conditions

### Risk Ledger
- **Starting daily risk budget**: $300 (3% of account)
- **Approved trades risk**: $75 (0.75% of account)
- **Remaining daily risk**: $225 (available for 2 more trades at current 1% per-trade rate)
- **Active positions**: 1 of 3 max

## Tomorrow's Priorities
1. **XAUUSD entry**: Monitor for 1H pullback/retest on $2,870 entry zone
2. **GBPUSD hold**: Await tighter SL setup (target 1.3510 or better) to reduce position size
3. **USDJPY hold**: Await deeper pullback or narrower stop target for better positioning
4. **Market watch**: AUS CPI data release today; tariff news flow continues
5. **Risk tracking**: Monitor daily loss — remaining budget is $225

## Notes for Trader
- Strong signal generation from Trigger; thesis quality is good
- Position sizing constraint is the real limiter, not signal quality
- Consider account size or risk parameter adjustment if running into sizing issues on multiple signals
- Gold priority is justified (stagflation hedge + high confidence)
- GBPUSD and USDJPY are hold, not skip — they'll work when setup geometry improves
