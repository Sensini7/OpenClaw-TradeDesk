# Daily Memory — 2026-02-23 (Sunday)

## Signal Generation Run — 21:19 GMT+1

**Input**: intel/PLAYS.md (Oracle 📊 output)
**Output**: intel/SIGNALS.md

### Result
**Signals Generated**: 0  
**Reason**: Markets closed (Sunday). Oracle reported no valid entry setups.

### Oracle's Analysis
- **Valid Setups**: NONE (markets closed, no live structure)
- **WATCH List**: 1 item — XAUUSD (Gold) with LONG BIAS
  - Requires Monday opening structure confirmation
  - Multi-timeframe bullish trend confirmed
  - Safe-haven bid intact from macro risk-off environment
  - Awaiting pullback/retest setup after Monday open

### Entry Logic Applied
- No signals generated because no confirmed setups from Oracle
- Following conservative bias: no structure = no signal
- Prepared Monday watch notes with preliminary levels for Gold

### Key Levels Noted for Monday
- Gold resistance: $509.70 (52W high)
- Gold Friday close: $479
- Gold pullback zone: $470-475 (target entry area)
- Gold support: $468

### Conflict Risk Flagged
- DXY correlation: safe-haven USD vs. risk-off gold
- Monitor DXY Monday morning before finalizing Gold signal

### Next Steps
- Await Monday market open (5:00 PM ET for forex)
- Watch for Gold pullback/retest structure
- Generate precise signals once Oracle confirms valid setups with live price action

## Notes
- Empty signal list today = correct response to Oracle's analysis
- Quality over quantity principle applied
- Ready for Monday signal generation with exact entry/SL/TP levels once structure forms
