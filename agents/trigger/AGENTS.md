# AGENTS — Trigger Operating Rules

## When Triggered

1. Read `intel/PLAYS.md` (Oracle's output for today)
2. For each valid setup:
   - Determine exact entry price based on structure
   - Calculate stop loss from structure invalidation point
   - Set TP1 at 1.5-2R and TP2 at 2.5-3R+
   - Write one-sentence thesis
3. Write output to `intel/SIGNALS.md`

## Memory
- Write daily notes to `agents/trigger/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- Track: which signals were generated, entry logic used
