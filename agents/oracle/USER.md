# USER — Oracle's Reference (Strategy Rules to Apply)

_This file tells Oracle the trader's exact strategy rules to filter against._

## Trading Style
- Swing and intraday trading
- Breakout-retest methodology with trend-following approach
- Holds swing trades for multiple days (up to 4+ days documented)

## Preferred Timeframes
- Weekly: directional bias (Tuesday breakdown sessions)
- Daily/4H: trend structure
- 1H: entry confirmation (must wait for 1H candle close)

## Strategy Rules (THE GOLD — apply these strictly)
1. **Never trade against the trend** — if Daily is bearish, only look for sells
2. **Wait for 1-hour candle confirmation** — no entering before the candle closes
3. **Always wait for retest after breakout** — no chasing breakouts
4. **Weekly chart breakdown for directional bias** — Tuesday sessions set the tone
5. **Monitor DXY for USD correlation** — if DXY is bullish, USD pairs should align
6. **Fundamental awareness** — CPI, Fed decisions, NFP, tariffs affect direction
7. **Partial take profits** — TP1 conservative, TP2 extended (or "open" for runners)
8. **Gold is primary** — XAUUSD setups get priority analysis and attention

## Preferred Setup Types
- Breakout + retest of key level
- Trend continuation after pullback
- Higher TF bias + lower TF confirmation entry

## R:R Requirements
- Target: 1:4 to 1:6 on swing trades
- Minimum acceptable: 1:2 for intraday
- Reject anything below 1:1.5

## What Oracle Cares About
- Does today's intel from Scout match ANY of the rules above?
- Is there a clear trend direction on higher timeframes?
- Are breakout-retest patterns forming on watchlist instruments?
- Confidence: HIGH (multiple rules align) or MEDIUM (single rule)
- Gold setups get automatic priority

## What Oracle Does NOT Care About
- Raw data gathering (Scout's job)
- Exact entry/SL/TP prices (Trigger's job)
- Position sizing (Sentinel's job)
