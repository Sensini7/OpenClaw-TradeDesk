# Oracle Memory — 2026-02-23 (Sunday)

## Session Summary
First manual trigger by user on Sunday evening (21:17 GMT+1). Ran full analysis workflow on Scout's weekend report.

## Intel Processed
- **Source**: intel/DAILY-INTEL.md (Scout 🔭 report from 20:14 GMT)
- **Market Status**: Forex closed (Sunday)
- **Macro Theme**: Risk-off (tariff crisis + AI fears driving equity selloff)

## Strategy Filter Applied
### Gold (XAUUSD) — WATCH
- **Trend**: ✅ Bullish on all timeframes (Rule #1 satisfied)
- **Fundamentals**: ✅ Safe-haven bid from tariff/AI fears (Rule #6)
- **Priority**: ✅ Gold is primary (Rule #8)
- **Missing**: Entry structure — markets closed, cannot confirm breakout-retest (Rule #3) or 1H candle close (Rule #2)
- **Decision**: Placed on WATCH list for Monday opening. Instructed to wait for pullback to $470-475 or retest of $479. DO NOT CHASE gaps.

### Forex Pairs (USDJPY, EURUSD, etc.)
- **Decision**: FILTERED OUT — no live data, cannot assess trend direction (Rule #1)
- **Note**: High volatility expected Monday opening from weekend gap risk

## DXY Alert
- Flagged potential conflict: Safe-haven USD vs. risk-off gold
- Reminder to monitor DXY correlation Monday (Rule #5)

## Key Decisions
1. **Zero actionable setups** — correct output for closed markets
2. Gold has strongest case but needs Monday structure confirmation
3. Tuesday weekly breakdown (Rule #4) will refine directional bias

## Lessons
- Sunday analysis = pre-positioning only, not actionable trades
- Resisted temptation to "fill the page" with weak setups
- Strict adherence to rules: no entry structure = no play

## Next Steps
- Monitor Monday 5:00 PM ET forex open
- Wait for Tuesday weekly breakdown session
- Update plays if gold presents valid entry setup
